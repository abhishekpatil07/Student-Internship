# Student-Internship
The project is an Internship System for a College or a University . 
Its role is assisting with internship placements for a College or a University. It is a simple user interface which has two types of users: admin and students. The internship system can be used to keep track of companies, internship openings, skills. This system results in a systematic and organized grouping of data. 
I've made use of php,html,CSS,JavaScript for this project and run using XAMPP software.
